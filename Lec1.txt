So today, we will be discussing github and its commands.

Github is a VCS i.e. it is a version control system.
The main purpose of a version control system is to enable proper file management and have the history of all the 
versions of our project without having to manually store each version.

Let's talk some common terms:

1. Repo-It is a virtual storage location for managing and tracking file.
2. Add-This helps us to stage changes from working directory to the stagging area.
3. Pull-It helps us to sync our local repo to remote repo.
4. Clone-It creates a copy of remote repo to our local repo.
5. Stage-When you make changes and apply add command your changes are stagged to commit.
6. Commit-It is like a snapshot of your work which saves the current changes of your working directories.
7. Push-It means transferring your local repo to remote repo.
8. Fork-Creating a copy of project repo on your github account.
9. Branch-Within a repo it helps us to work on different line.
10. Merge-This command helps us to combining the two branch.
11. README-It is file that is usually created to save information about the repo.
12. Status-This command shows the current status whether the there are changes and what have to be commited.
13. Restore-As the name suggest it restore the changes in local repo.
14. Fetch-It downloads the files from remote repo to local repo.
15. Init-It changes any directory to git directory.

Now, I would like all of you to clone this repo, update this file by filling in details of the commands, and pushing this file to your new repo.

For reference, I would encourage all of you to go through official git documentation.
